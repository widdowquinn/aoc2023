    "My approach was to identify the locations of all the symbols (`get_symbol_locs`) then iterate through all the elements in the `numpy` array of the data. There's a buffer that stores the number currently being built (`curnum`) and digits are added to this as we find them, iterating through the array. We also check to see if the current position is adjacent to a symbol and, if so, a flag (`symadj`) to indicate symbol-adjacency is tripped. The number is stopped and added to a stack/list as an int - along with the symbol-adjacency flag - when we hit a new row or a symbol.\n",
